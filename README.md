Unreal Map Flipper (work in progress)

In UnrealEd, export map to a .t3d file, run this program on it, then import the map into UnrealEd again using the "Import a new map" option. Now go to Options -> Rebuild (F8) and click the Rebuild Geometry button. If you don't have any textures that means you didn't have the original map loaded when you did the import. Now you can save the map for real and load it into your game!
